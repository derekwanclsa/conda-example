# Interview task

## Overview
In this task, I would like you to conduct a small research project entirely from scratch.
It is designed to be representative of the tasks & challenges we face, and is *extremely* open-ended on purpose.

## Task
We will construct a simple momentum signal on the [S&P100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_100).
We will use:

- [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) to the fetch free data,
- [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) to organize and analyze it, and
- [jupyter lab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/) to present it. 
  - Feel free to use any visualization library of your choice.

## Setup
You must use:

- this current Windows machine, and
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the code.
- [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), a Python environment manager.

Everyone as their own development environment.
You are welcome to go and
configure your own; we only focus on the end result.
However, as time is limited, this may well be infeasible.
Hence, the following are provided,
and you will be walked through their configuration
(as you cannot be expected to be familiar with them):

- [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), a command-line git client.
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), an IDE.

### GitHub and conda

- Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/) as `derekwanclsa`.
- Create a new private repo with your name:
- Use `git bash` to clone the repo:

- In `anaconda prompt`, navigate to your repo and run `conda env create --force`:
